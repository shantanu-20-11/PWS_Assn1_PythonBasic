        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility across various domains like web development, data science, automation, and software engineering. Its popularity stems from its beginner-friendly syntax, extensive libraries, active community support, and adaptability to diverse tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, turning human-written programs into instructions a computer can understand and act upon instantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and serve as the fundamental building blocks of the language's syntax and structure. These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers in a Python program.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Python reserves these keywords for its own syntax and structure, so if a keyword is used as a variable name, it will result in a syntax error. Variable names must follow rules such as starting with a letter or underscore, containing only alphanumeric characters or underscores, and not being any of Python's reserved keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   -> Mutability in Python refers to whether an object's value can be changed after it is created. A mutable object can be modified in place without changing its identity, while an immutable object cannot be altered once created; any modifications result in a new object being created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Lists are mutable in Python because they are designed to allow modifications after creation, meaning their contents can be changed, added to, or removed. This flexibility makes lists ideal for dynamic collections of data where changes are expected. Internally, lists use a dynamic array structure that supports efficient resizing and element updates. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed. This immutability provides advantages such as fixed size, faster iteration, lower memory usage, and safer data structures that prevent accidental modification. Tuples are often used for fixed collections of heterogeneous data or when immutability is desired for data integrity or as dictionary keys (hashability).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The difference between == and is operators in Python lies in what they compare: == checks for equality: it compares the values of two objects to see if they are the same. For example, two separate lists with identical contents are considered equal with ==. is checks for identity: it checks whether two variables point to the exact same object in memory. Even if two objects have the same value, is will return False if they are different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False). There are three main logical operators: and: Returns True if both operands are True. or: Returns True if at least one operand is True. not: Returns True if the operand is False, and vice versa (negates the condition).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often necessary when performing operations between incompatible types or when a specific data type is required.\n",
        "   Two Types of Type Casting: Implicit Type Casting: Automatically done by Python without user intervention, where Python converts one data type to another to avoid data loss or to perform an operation smoothly (e.g., integer to float in arithmetic operations). Explicit Type Casting (Type Casting): Done manually by the user using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc., to convert a value deliberately to a desired data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python lies in who performs the type conversion and how it is done: Implicit Type Casting Also called implicit type conversion or coercion. Happens automatically by Python without the programmer's intervention. Python internally converts a lower data type to a higher data type when necessary to avoid data loss or errors. Example: When an integer is added to a float, Python converts the integer to float implicitly. Advantage: Convenient, reduces coding effort. Disadvantage: Can sometimes lead to unexpected results or loss of precision if not carefully understood.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by executing certain blocks of code based on whether specific conditions are true or false. They allow a program to make decisions and behave differently in different situations, enabling dynamic and flexible code execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if condition. It allows the program to evaluate a new condition only if all the previous conditions were false. This helps in making decisions among more than two alternatives. How elif Works When Python encounters an if-elif-else block, it first checks the if condition. If the if condition is True, its block executes, and the rest (elif and else) are skipped. If the if condition is False, Python moves to the first elif condition. If an elif condition is True, its block executes, and remaining conditions are skipped. If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the code inside the else block (if present) runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The main difference between for and while loops in Python lies in how they control the repetition of code execution:For Loop Used when the number of iterations is known or finite. Iterates over a sequence or iterable like lists, tuples, strings, or ranges. Automatically handles the iteration variable. Example use case: Looping through all elements in a list. python for i in range(5): print(i)\n",
        "   The loop runs exactly 5 times, counting from 0 to 4. While Loop Used when the number of iterations is unknown or depends on a condition. Repeats execution as long as the specified condition remains True. Requires manual updating of variables used in the condition to avoid infinite loops.\n",
        "   Example use case: Repeating until user input is valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown or uncertain and depends on a condition being met rather than a fixed sequence or count. Scenario Example: Suppose a program needs to repeatedly prompt a user for input until they enter a valid response. Since the number of attempts isn't predetermined, a while loop is ideal because it continues looping based on a condition (valid input) rather than a fixed range."
